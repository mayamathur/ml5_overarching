The original questionnaire wording and format will be replicated exactly. The authors raised the concern that the scenario given in the questionnaire (about to being in a lecture class) may be more relatable to undergraduates than to other, non-student demographics. If so, theoretically, the effect of tempting fate could be attenuated. Potentially, also, our subjects could exhibit floor or ceiling effects not seen in the original sample if they perceive a substantially lower or higher baseline probability of being called on in class. An additional problem suggested by the authors is the possibility that an online environment may not allow adequate control of cognitive load, since participants are likely to have more environmental distractions than they would in a traditional lab setting.

Otherwise, we used the same materials as were provided but for one exception where we added a scale because when we were going through the script at the end the script said to tell the participant assigned to the video condition that we had an extra measure for them to complete, as we couldn't determine what that extra measure was in the materials we included a rejection sensitivity scale. There was a single-item that asked how many faults they thought their partner listed, but this was just at the end of the post-manipulation survey and so was administered in conjunction with those materials. We added an item to the note coding scheme because we had a decent number of couple members simply volunteer to take their partner's place for the video that we added it to coding but that would not have affected administration.",Somewhat similar,Somewhat similar,Moderately challenging,Results were slightly surprising,X,1,No data used was pre-existing,Social,91,t,is,1,83,3.05,<,0.01,0.003071238,0.003071238,,0.317462994,76,t,is,1,68,-1.124,is,0.265,0.2649653,0.2649653,,-0.1351,,hierarchical regression analyses,hierarchical regression analyses,,1,0,1,83,68,0.119839749,0,0136,The value of believing in free will: Encouraging a belief in determinism increases cheating.,"KD Vohs, JW Schooler",PS,19,1,49-54,https://osf.io/i29mh/,"Culture, Deception, Female, Genetic Determinism, Humans, Internal-External Control, Male, Moral Development, Personal Autonomy, Persuasive Communication, Problem Solving, Social Environment",2,3,Vohs,19845,University of Minnesota,Vohs,19845,University of Minnesota,Embley,0,University of Kent,Giner-Sorolla,2052,University of Kent,341,3.64,3.64,2.61,2.61,2,Social,1,Collected themselves,Slight expertise required,Moderate opportunity for researcher expectations to influence results,Moderate opportunity for lack of diligence to affect the results,3.75,3.75,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,R Giner-Sorolla,1/1/12,2/15/13,R Giner-Sorolla,1,t(28) = 3.04,30,<.01,,,independent samples t-test,main effect,"""Participants cheated more frequently after reading the anti-free-will essay than after reading the control essay""",d = .88,,44,58,70,Complete,58,0.9,2,M Motyl,t(56) = -.77,58,0.44,same,,independent samples t-test,main effect,no,0.91,d = .20,M Motyl,"We chose Study 1 because of the financial infeasibility of doing Study 2 with adequate power, given that participants could receive up to 15 USD pay and the original author alerted us to errors in the article's analysis pointed out by a reader after publication, so that the correct effect size was lower than that published.",1,https://osf.io/eyk8w/,PhD or equivalent,1996,Professor (or equivalent),High Expertise,High Expertise,44,33,2052,was of moderately higher quality than the original study,was slightly better than the average study,Very similar,Different participant population (though details of the participants were not provided in the original),,Not at all similar,Somewhat challenging,Results were slightly surprising,X,1,No data used was pre-existing,Social,30,t,is,1,28,3.04,<,0.01,0.005086904,0.005086904,,0.498149178,58,t,is,1,56,-0.77,is,0.44,0.444536036,0.444536036,,0.102355162,,independent samples t-test,t-test,,1,0,1,28,56,0.24895166,0,1161,Detecting the snake in the grass: attention to fear-relevant stimuli by adults and young children.,"V Lobue, JS DeLoache",PS,19,3,284-9,https://osf.io/sd7kg/,"Adult, Age Factors, Animals, Attention, Child, Preschool, Fear, Field Dependence-Independence, Humans, Pattern Recognition, Visual, Reaction Time, Snakes",2,5,Lobue,563,University of Virginia,DeLoache,8201,University of Virginia,Cramblet Alvarez,6,Adams State University,Cramblet Alvarez,6,Adams State University,143,4.36,4.36,1.4,1.4,3,Cognitive,1,Collected themselves,Slight expertise required,Slight opportunity for researcher expectations to influence results,Slight opportunity for lack of diligence to affect the results,2,3.67,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,L Cramblet Alvarez,1/17/13,11/19/14,L Cramblet Alvarez,3,"F(1, 44) = 13.42",48,<.01,,,between ANOVA,main effect,"Both children and adultsê reaction times to stimuli were faster for fear-relevant conditions, as opposed to fear-irrelevant conditions",__p^2 = . 23,,33,40,50,Complete,35,0.85,2,J Goss,"F(1, 44) = 1.437",48,0.237,same,2,between ANOVA,main effect,no,0.9,_2 = .032,E Baranski,"original author indicated ""2"" for her assessment because she preferred we replicate experiment #2 rather than #3",1,https://osf.io/p67kr/,PhD or equivalent,2005,Professor (or equivalent),Some Expertise,Some Expertise,4,2,2,was about the same quality as the original study,was about the same as the average study,Extremely similar,use of different data collection program (written for the study),Very similar,Very similar,Somewhat challenging,Results were slightly surprising,X,3,No data used was pre-existing,Education/school,48,F,is,1,44,13.42,<,0.01,0.000665379,0.000665379,,0.483442318,48,F,is,1,44,1.437,is,0.237,0.237041962,0.237041962,,0.177837588,,2x2x2 between subjects ANOVA,2X2X2 ANOVA,,1,0,1,44,44,0.353607781,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NA,,,NA,,,,,,,,,NA,,,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,
